/*Data Abstraction

Interface
-------------
Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details
and showing only functionality to the user.

Interface
-------------
An interface is a blueprint of class.
Interface contains final & Static variables by default.
Interface contains abstract methods.( also allowed default methods & Static methods from java8 onwards)
An abstract method is a method contains definition but not body(Un-implemented method).
Methods in interface are public.
Interface supports the functionality of multiple inheritance.
We can define interface with interface keyword.
A class extends another class, an interface extends another interface but aÂ class implements an interface.
We can create Object reference for Interface but we cannot instantiate interface.
